# Inventory-Management-System

This is a Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) application which I've developed for managing auto spare parts inventory. The system utilizes various technologies including Java, Spring Core, Spring MVC, Hibernate, and Servlets. Its main purpose is to provide a web-based user interface for efficiently managing and tracking orders, as well as performing CRUD operations on items in the inventory.

Features
- Web-based UI: The system offers a user-friendly web interface that allows users to interact with the inventory management functionalities seamlessly.

- Order Management: Users can create, update, and track orders for spare parts, enabling efficient handling of customer requests.

- Item Manipulation: CRUD operations are implemented to enable easy manipulation of items within the inventory, including adding new items, updating existing ones, and deleting items.

- Concurrency Handling: Spring MVC is used to build the application, ensuring its ability to handle multiple concurrent requests from users without sacrificing performance or data integrity.

- Database Mapping: Hibernate is employed to map Java objects to relational database tables, simplifying the process of storing and retrieving data. SQL queries are utilized to fetch and manipulate data as needed.

- Request Handling: Servlets are utilized to handle HTTP requests and responses, providing a streamlined approach to managing the web application's lifecycle.
 
- Deployment and Testing: The application has been successfully deployed using a local Tomcat Server, ensuring its functionality and performance have been thoroughly tested.
